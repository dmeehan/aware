                  <p>Cheryl’s interest in understanding and enhancing the welfare of zoo animals has been the motivating force in her academic and professional pursuits for the past fifteen years. She combines this interest with skills in applied research and education in her role as director of AWARE Institute. Cheryl is author of peer-reviewed papers on stereotypic behavior, environmental enrichment, and social management of animals, among others. She served as the consulting project manager for the Using Science to Understand Zoo Elephant Welfare project where she applied her skills in collaborative project management and software design to support the systematic welfare assessment of nearly the entire AZA population of African and Asian elephants.</p>

                  <p>As an animal welfare scientist and former zoo elephant trainer,Brian’s research efforts are directed towards using science to improve the lives of animals. He is particularly interested in understandinghow environmental (e.g., space experience and use) and managerial factors (e.g., the use of operant conditioning) influence stereotypic and social behavior. He is also interested in using cognitive challenges as a way of inferring subjective experience and as a means of environmental enrichment. In addition to his role with AWARE, Brian is completing his PhD in Animal Biology at the UC Davis under the guidance of Joy Mench.</p>
